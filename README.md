## Feature

- Automatically paint a tile when a mouse is hovering on top
- 10-Steps gradient - Each interaction will increase the tile colour richness by 10%
- Two paint modes
  - Monochrome - From light grey to black
  - Multicolour - Randomised colour 
- Canvas size control 
  - Select the Upwards Arrow to increase the grid size
  - Select the Downwards Arrow to decrease the grid size
- Current version is a fixed size desktop only experience

## UX Consideration

- A toy-like user interface to mimic the original Etch-a-Sketch design
- Shadow around the canvas to add depth to the interface
- Control buttons are placed within the two dials to maintain aesthetics
- User feedback: Buttons change colour based on interaction types 
- User feedback: Disable grid control when grid size limit is reached
